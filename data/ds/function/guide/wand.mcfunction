tellraw @s ["",{"text":"Getting Wands","color":"aqua"},"\nTo try to get a wand, you need to use Spectral Stars. You can see how to get Spectral Stars by using ",{"text":"/trigger guide set 3","color":"dark_green"},". Each Spectral Star has a 10% chance to give you a rare wand or item and a 1% chance to give you a legendary wand. However, there is a pity system in cases where you have not gotten a rare or legendary for extended periods of time. If you use 99 Spectral Stars without getting a legendary, your 100th Spectral Star is guaranteed to give you a legendary. If you use 9 Spectral Stars without getting a rare, your 10th Spectral Star is guaranteed to give you a rare or legendary.\n\nTo allow you to have more control on which rare or legendary you get, the wands rotate around on banners. Each banner consists of one legendary wand and two rare wands. If you get a legendary from a Spectral Star, it is guaranteed that it is the legendary wand on the current banner. Similarly, if you get a rare wand from a Spectral Star, it is guaranteed that it is one of the rare wands on the current banner. However, do note that if you get a rare item, it is not always guaranteed to be a wand.\n\nThe banner will change every Minecraft day. To see the current banner, use /trigger banner"]
