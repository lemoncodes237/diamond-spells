Put the wand you wish to ascend in your mainhand, and put the Ascension 0 wand in your offhand. Then, right click while crouching. This will consume the Ascension 0 wand and increase the ascension level of the wand in your mainhand.\n\nThis means that in order to level up a wand to Ascension 5, you need six copies of it.\n "]
